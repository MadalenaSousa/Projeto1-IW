                Thomas Castro founded LUST  with Jeroen Barendse, and Dimitri Nieuwenhuizen, a multidisciplinary graphic
                design practice established in 1996 by , based in The Hague, Netherlands. LUST is deeply interested in
                exploring new pathways for design at the cutting edge where new media and information technologies,
                architecture and urban systems and graphic design overlap.

                This fascination led to establishing LUSTlab in the summer of 2010. LUSTlab is more than a new form of
                Research & Development. LUSTlab goes further than observing, inventing and producing, by means of forming
                a platform where knowledge, issues and ideologies can be shared.

                LUSTlab researches, generates hypotheses and makes unstable media stable again. The future of digital
                media lies in the design of its use. Humanizing the unhuman, bringing the internet down to earth and finding
                the missing link between the digital and the physical. The outcomes vary from (strategic) visions to new
                communication tools, man-machine installations and physical products using digital content.

                Born 1969) studied graphic design at IADE (Lisbon) until 1993. Before finishing his degree he started
                to work as a graphic designer at Surf Portugal magazine. In 1994 he founded his design studio (Secretonix)
                that produced a wide range of design projects from editorial to corporate design. After having commissioned
                one typeface for Adobe (called Strumpf) and after publishing some of his early work in other foundries,
                in 2001 he creates the Feliciano Type Foundry and starts to publish his own designs and creating custom
                typefaces for clients around the world.

                He is also a member of AGI (Alliance Graphique Internationale) since 2009. He is the author of several
                custom typefaces, such as: Expresso (for the Portuguese weekly newspaper Expresso), Sueca (for the Swedish
                newspaper Svenska Dagbladet), Majerit (for the Spanish newspaper El País) and BesSans for Banco Espírito Santo.
                His most popular typeface is Flama that is used as a customised version on the Portuguese Passport and Citizen
                Card along with his other typeface Merlo. In the recent years Mário has been working on expanding FTF's library
                and giving typographic consultancy.

                Luna runs the Amsterdam-based design studio Moniker with Roel Wouters. (They founded it in 2012 with
                Jonathan Puckey.) Moniker “explores the characteristics of technology, how people use it, and how it
                influences people’s daily lives. "They’ve taught media courses at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, the Sandberg
                Institute and at Yale University, and they regularly give workshops and lectures around the world.

                Moniker, together with Edo Paulus, wrote Conditional Design, a manifesto and “experimental playground”
                that they have said is “based on the notion that designing a logic-based environment within which results
                take shape are more interesting and fruitful than a directly designed object.” They tested these ideas during
                weekly workshops, which were then posted online. The Conditional Design Workbook was published in 2013 by Valiz.
                Here, Maurer discusses what it means to break down complicated ideas, the importance of having a guiding
                manifesto, and the difference (or lack thereof) between an artist and a designer.
